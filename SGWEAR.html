      <p class="detail-intro">SGWEAR is a project born in 2016 by Sandra González and Melanie Plaza. A project that was born motivated by offering young people a different brand, with which they could feel identified and that defended some very important values for the new generations, such as caring for the planet or freedom of expression.
<br><br>
From the beginning, they have put a lot of effort into developing a brand image through communication actions focused on responsible consumption and the use of sustainable materials. They have collaborated with numerous influencers and participated in events such as the Animal Sound music festival and CREAMURCIA, where they were finalists.
<br><br>
With the aim of boosting their online sales and their presence on the internet, they decided to develop a website that would showcase their values and offer a simple and comfortable sales experience for users.
<br><br>
At the end of 2020, the development of what would become the new website for the SGWEAR brand began. </p>

      <h2>problem</h2>
      <p>SGWEAR's previous website had a number of problems ranging from a poor user experience to a lack of visual consistency. The website did not give users confidence and the level of sales made through it was very low. Therefore, the main objective was, on the one hand, to address these issues and, on the other hand, to make SGWEAR's website reflect the brand identity and provide a modern and trustworthy look and feel for the user. <br> <br>  It was also important to ensure that the page could be easily modified by someone without a lot of knowledge, as well as being able to add or remove products without much complication. </p>

      <h2>design process</h2>

      <h3>research + exploration</h3>
      <p>Together with the two founders of the brand, we will embark on a process of research and prototyping that will last around 2 months and from which the first version of the website will emerge. A website that will be in continuous iteration until we reach a satisfactory result. However, the project is not completely finished, we are still looking for ways to optimise and improve the user experience of the website.</p>

      <img class="within-content-shadow" src="images/sgwearprototypes.png" alt="prototyping"/>

      <h3>execution</h3>
      <p>Once the final structure of the page is defined, I proceed to start building the page in Wordpress with the help of the Elementor plugin. The page will be built from scratch, i.e. without any kind of template.

Despite using the Elementor plugin, it will be necessary, in some cases, the use of html and CSS code to achieve the desired results.

The page you can see today is the result of multiple iterations during its first year of life.

      <h2>results</h2>
      <p>The results obtained after continuous iterations have resulted in a website that achieved the objectives set at the beginning, i.e. that reflected the brand identity, that could be modified internally without much complexity and that offered a satisfactory user experience.   <br><br>

In terms of economic results, thanks to the website, the brand achieved record sales, increasing them by more than 400%.   <br><br>

The next steps, still to be taken, are to improve certain aspects of the website, such as the menu in the desktop version and the payment process for the mobile version, which, although it has already been improved to include the possibility of paying with Apple and Google Pay, still has room for improvement if we talk about the step in which the customer must enter their shipping details.
   <br><br> This was the first time I’ve ever built a website, and although it was a challenge, I’ve learned much about the design process, CSS and HTML, Wordpress, and how it could be a challenge to maintain and unify the whole website consistently, even if there is still room for improvement on this area.</p>
